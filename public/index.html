      Hello. This is a usage stats server for Smogon data. 
      Please don't hammer it, I'm paying out of pocket. 
      I will work on some way to allow cloning of the data. 
      For now, please use the repo for the 
      database and the web-scraping   
      <a href="https://github.com/Stu-Gotz/smog_usage_stats">here</a> 
      you should hopefully just have to press run twice in the
      two Python files (<code>DBManager.py</code> and <code>smogon_pull.py</code>).
      You'll have to set it up yourself but if you don't 
      know basic DB stuff, and want to be a better programmer 
      it's a good skill to have to at least be able to 
      bullshit confidently. 
      <br>
      Have fun.
