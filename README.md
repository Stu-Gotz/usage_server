## TO USE

Is not hosted yet, but I hope to do that over the course of the week, to find the crossroad between easiest and cheapest. 

`address.url/:date/:tier`

`date` must be in the following format: `YYYY-MM`, example: `2019-08` for August 2015. Data does not exist before November 2014.

`tier` must look like it does in Showdown, so for 7th Generation OU, you would enter `gen7ou`. 

resulting in: `address.url/2019-08/gen7ou/`
